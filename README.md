# SpotlightFaves
1st python project
intended to save windows spotlight images that I like to a separate folder before the OS cycles them off my workstation

Phase 1: copies all files from default OS folder to destination folder
Phase 2: figure out how to use git hub with this project
Phase 3: config file (destination folder, portrait / landscape / both, min size cut off, ...?)
Phase 4: basic UI to alter config
Phase 5: database to track which images have been processed.
Phase 6: UI updates to review images
...profit?
